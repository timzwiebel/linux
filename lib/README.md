# Custom binary/script libraries

# Install
These binaries/scripts should **not** be added to `PATH` since they are not
intended to be invoked directly by users. Therefore, no installation is
necessary. These libraries should be called by other scripts using the full path
(e.g., `${HOME}/linux/lib/<file>`).
