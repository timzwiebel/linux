# Custom Binary/Script Libraries


# Install
These are custom scripts that are required by other scripts/configs. There are
also executable scripts that are not intended to be invoked directly by users
and therefore should not be added to `PATH`. Therefore, no installation is
necessary.


# Libraries
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [Shell](shell/README.md)
