# Custom Binary/Script Libraries

# Install
These are custom scripts that are required by other scripts/configs. There are
also executable scripts that are not intended to be invoked directly by users
and therefore should not be added to `PATH`. Therefore, no installation is
necessary.

Scripts outside of this repository should reference these using the full path
(e.g., `${HOME}/linux/lib/<file>`).
