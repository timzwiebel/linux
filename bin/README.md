# Custom Binaries/Scripts

# Install (add `bin/` to `PATH`)
These are custom executable scripts that are intended to be invoked directly by
users. If you want to make them callable from any directory, add this directory
(`bin/`) to `PATH` (see [Bash#Install](../config/bash/README.md#install)).

# Binaries
- `print_args`: print the arguments passed to this command

- `rgrep`: call `grep` while excluding `EXCLUDED_SEARCH_DIRS`
