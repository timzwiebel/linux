# Install
These are custom executable scripts that are intended to be invoked directly by
users and therefore should be added to `PATH` (see
[Bash#Install](../config/bash/README.md#install)).

- `rfind`: call `find` while excluding `_EXCLUDED_SEARCH_DIRS`
- `rgrep`: call `grep` while excluding `_EXCLUDED_SEARCH_DIRS`
